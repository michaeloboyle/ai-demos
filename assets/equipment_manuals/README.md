## Usage in Field Support Demo

### Chatbot Knowledge Base
The AI field technician uses this database to:
1. **Answer equipment questions** with real specifications
2. **Provide troubleshooting guidance** based on actual procedures
3. **Cross-reference compatibility** between equipment types
4. **Suggest maintenance procedures** from official sources

### Conversation Examples
```
User: "What are the specs for helicopter communication equipment?"
AI: [References actual FAA equipment registry data]

User: "How do I troubleshoot radio interference?"
AI: [Uses real NTSB incident analysis procedures]
```

### Multi-turn Support
- **Context retention**: Maintains conversation history
- **Equipment identification**: Helps identify specific models
- **Procedure lookup**: Retrieves step-by-step instructions
- **Safety warnings**: Highlights critical safety considerations
