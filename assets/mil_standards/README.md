# MIL Standards Database

Official government standards for military compliance validation and regulatory checking.

## Purpose

**Primary Demo**: `compliance_demo.ipynb` - Military Compliance Assistant
**Secondary Demo**: `knowledge_base/` integration for technical specifications

## Contents

- `mil_standards_database.json` - Master database (3 official standards)
- Individual JSON files for each standard
- Government source verification data
- Official API collection metadata

## Government Standards (3 verified)

### **1. FED-STD-595C** - Colors Used in Government Procurement
- **Source**: GSA Federal Standards
- **Purpose**: Standard color specifications for defense contracts
- **API Source**: https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/acquisition-policy/federal-acquisition-regulation-far
- **Status**: âœ… Official government publication

### **2. FED-STD-313** - Material Safety Data for Hazardous Materials
- **Source**: GSA Federal Standards
- **Purpose**: Hazardous material data sheets and transportation requirements
- **API Source**: https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/acquisition-policy/federal-acquisition-regulation-far
- **Status**: âœ… Official government publication

### **3. NASA-STD-5017** - Design and Development Requirements for Mechanisms
- **Source**: NASA Technical Standards Program
- **Purpose**: Engineering design requirements for space and defense mechanisms
- **API Source**: https://standards.nasa.gov/standard/nasa/nasa-std-5017
- **Status**: âœ… Official government publication

## Data Collection Method

### **Official Government APIs**
- **ASSIST Database**: Defense acquisition standards portal
- **GSA Standards**: Federal acquisition regulation standards
- **NASA Technical Standards**: Space and defense engineering standards

### **Verification Process**
1. **API Access**: Direct programmatic access to government databases
2. **Source Verification**: Cross-referenced against official publications
3. **Metadata Validation**: Confirmed publication dates and authorities
4. **Content Authentication**: Matched against authoritative sources

## Usage in Compliance Demo

### **Document Validation**
The AI compliance assistant uses these standards to:
1. **Parse uploaded documents** for compliance requirements
2. **Cross-reference** against official government standards
3. **Generate traffic light matrix** showing compliance status
4. **Provide remediation suggestions** based on official requirements

### **Compliance Workflow**
```
User uploads defense contract document
    â†“
AI extracts requirements and specifications
    â†“
Cross-references against MIL standards database
    â†“
Generates compliance matrix:
ðŸŸ¢ Compliant requirements
ðŸŸ¡ Needs attention
ðŸ”´ Non-compliant items
    â†“
Provides official remediation guidance
```

### **AI Analysis Examples**
- **Color specifications**: Validates against FED-STD-595C requirements
- **Material safety**: Checks hazmat compliance per FED-STD-313
- **Design requirements**: Verifies mechanism design per NASA-STD-5017
